    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will implement a simple Perceptron classifier to classify digits (or anything else).\n",
    "\n",
    "How to submit: You can submit your code using the red Submit button above. This button will send any code below surrounded by #<GRADED>#</GRADED> tags below to the autograder, which will then run several tests over your code. By clicking on the Details dropdown next to the Submit button, you will be able to view your submission report once the autograder has completed running. This submission report contains a summary of the tests you have failed or passed, as well as a log of any errors generated by your code when we ran it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this may take a while depending on how long your code takes to run! Once your code is submitted you may navigate away from the page as you desire -- the most recent submission report will always be available from the Details menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation: Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please do not change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the correctness of your implementation -- not the autograder's output -- will be the final judge of your score. If necessary, we will review and grade assignments individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic Dishonesty: We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else's code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don't try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; please don't let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Help: You are not alone! If you find yourself stuck on something, contact the course staff for help. Office hours, section, and the Piazza are there for your support; please use them. If you can't make our office hours, let us know and we will schedule more. We want these projects to be rewarding and instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing. But, we don't know when or how to help unless you ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python initialization: Please run the following code to initialize your Python kernel. You should be running a version of Python 3.x.\n"
