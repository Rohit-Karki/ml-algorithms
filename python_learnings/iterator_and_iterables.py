# An iterable is any Python object that can return an iterator.
# It has a special method called __iter__(), which returns an iterator.


# An iterator is an object that produces the next value in a sequence when next() is called. It must implement:

# __iter__() â†’ returns the iterator itself.

# __next__() â†’ returns the next value in the sequence.

my_iter = iter(my_list)  # Converting list to iterator

print(next(my_iter))  # 2
print(next(my_iter))  # 3
print(next(my_iter))  # Raises StopIteration
